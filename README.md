## Description
The FibonacciSequence program calculates the nth Fibonacci number, where n is provided by the user. The Fibonacci sequence is a series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The program handles non-negative values for n and returns -1 for negative inputs.

## Installation Requirements
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use a package manager like Homebrew for macOS or apt-get for Linux. 

- Clone or download the repository: 
```Java 
- git clone https://github.com/your-username/FibonacciSequence.git 
```

- Navigate to the project directory: 
```Java
- cd FibonacciSequence 
```
- Compile the FibonacciSequence.java file: 
```Java
- javac FibonacciSequence.java 
```
- Run the program: 
```Java
- java FibonacciSequence
```

## Application Usage
Input an integer value: Enter a non-negative integer representing the position in the Fibonacci sequence you want to calculate. View the result: The program will output the Fibonacci number at the given position. Example:  

Input:
```Java 
5 
```
Output: 
```Java
fibonacci(5) is 5
```

Input:
```Java
-100
```
Output:
```Java
fibonacci(-100) is -1
```
